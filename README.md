Kolar is a multi-script OpenSource family of typefaces intended to support the publishing of long texts for immersive reading written in Kannada or a language that uses the Latin script. Five fonts are available: Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold. Each font’s character set includes 925 glyphs. This massive range supports hundreds of unique Kannada-script conjuncts.

Kolar’s Latin-script characters are all modified from Pablo Impallari’s Libre Baskerville series. Those fonts were optimised for 16px-high web body text; Kolar’s Kannada characters follow the irlead. Libre Baskerville is an excellent match for the Kannada script, because – like John Baskerville’s 18th century type – typographically-formed letters for Kannada text are almost always drawn with a high amount of vertical contrast. The horizontal elements along the bottoms of the letters in Kolar are very heavy, as may be expected.

Ramakrishna Saiteja designed Kolar’s Kannada character set for the Indian Type Foundry, who first published the Kolar fonts in 2016.
